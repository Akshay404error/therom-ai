-- Hello World in Theorem AI
-- This is a simple example to get started with Theorem AI

-- Define a simple greeting function
def hello : String := "Hello, Theorem AI!"

-- Define a mathematical function
def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) * factorial n

-- Define a list of numbers
def numbers : List Nat := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Define a function to sum a list
def sumList (xs : List Nat) : Nat :=
  match xs with
  | [] => 0
  | x :: xs => x + sumList xs

-- Evaluate and display results
#eval hello
#eval factorial 5
#eval sumList numbers

-- Define a simple theorem
theorem factorial_positive (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp [factorial]
  | succ n ih => 
    simp [factorial]
    apply Nat.mul_pos
    Â· exact Nat.succ_pos n
    Â· exact ih

-- Example of pattern matching
def describeNumber (n : Nat) : String :=
  match n with
  | 0 => "Zero"
  | 1 => "One"
  | 2 => "Two"
  | _ => "Many"

#eval describeNumber 0
#eval describeNumber 1
#eval describeNumber 5
